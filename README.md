# Super-Galactic-Age-Calculator

#### This page will take a users age and life expectancy inputs, and convert their age from Earth years to Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter years (if they are 1 years old on Earth, then they would be 0.24 years if they were from Mercury). Then if, they're older than the inputted life expectancy, it will show how many years they've lived passed the expectancy based on the planet.
